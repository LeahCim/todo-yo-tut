# todo-yo-tut

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt build` for building and `grunt serve` for preview and continuous
unit testing and on-demand end-to-end (E2E) testing (see details below).

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with Karma and end-to-end
(E2E) tests with Protractor.

Running `grunt` will run all tests (unit, E2E) and start the preview and
test servers for continuous unit testing and on-demand E2E testing.

Unit tests will run automatically upon file change. E2E tests are run on
demand with `protractor test/protractor.conf.js` once the test server has
been started with `grunt` or `grunt serve`.
